# Java Contracts

This is one of the many attempts to implement support for Design by Contract in Java that litter Github, Sourceforge, and other code sites.

## What is Design by Contract?

There's a nice explanation [on the Eiffel website](https://www.eiffel.com/values/design-by-contract/introduction/), so there's no need to reiterate it here. 

## Design goals

- Ease of use
- Useful exception messages
- Minimal source clutter
- No dependencies on additional packages that are likely to change or go off support
- No annotations
- No Java Agent 
- No special classpaths 
- No enable/disable (contracts are part of the solution)
